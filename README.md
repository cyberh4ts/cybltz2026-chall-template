## Instructions for use

> [!NOTE]
> Need a reference to an actual example challenge? Check out [commit2main/cybltz2026-example-challenge](https://github.com/commit2main/cybltz2026-example-challenge).

1. Copy the repository via ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=cybltz2026-chall-template&template_owner=cyberh4ts).
    - **Ensure your repository visibility is set to private!**
    - Update the repository name to match your challenge name
2. Push your challenge files.
    - **Please use a standardised flag of `CYBLTZ2026{example_flag}` to prevent any leaks!** If you have a suggested flag, please let the EXCOs know privately so we can include it for the actual challenge release
        - Is your flag hardcoded in the challenge files (e.g. steganography, crypto)? Provide the source files in `src/` and instructions on how to replace the flag in `README.md`
    - [`distrib/`](distrib/) should contain the files you want to distribute to the participants (if applicable)
    - [`src/`](src/) should contain files required to host your challenge or to create the distributable files (if applicable)
        - e.g. Flask app, mp3 files, plaintext files, etc.
3. Update Docker configuration (if applicable). [Need a guide?](https://docker-curriculum.com/)
    - **You may delete the Docker files if your challenge does not require hosting**
    - Update [`Dockerfile`](src/Dockerfile) such that it is a complete image that can run your challenge
    - Update [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) to include any additional services required to host your challenge (e.g. database, etc.)
4. **Remember to test your challenge first**!
    - You can use `docker compose up` to test your hosted challenge locally
    - Ensure the files in `distrib/` are sufficient for participants to solve the challenge
5. **Add a writeup and solution files.**
    - This will be used for the official writeup release after the competition, so make sure it is complete and easy to understand!
    - Use the [`sol/`](sol/) directory to include solution files (if applicable).
    - Update [`sol/README.md`](sol/README.md) with the writeup and instructions for the solution files
6. **Update `README.md`**.
    - Update the title ("CYBERBLITZ 2026 Challenge Template") to match your challenge name
    - Remove the "Instructions for use" section
    - Update the description, which will be used in the challenge listing
    - Update the hints section (if applicable)
    - Update the author section with your name or email or handle or LinkedIn or whatever
7. Once your challenge is ready, **add `@commit2main` (0x4973616163) as an admin collaborator** to your repository and inform the EXCOs.
    - You can add new collaborators from the "Settings" tab of your repository on Github, then "Collaborators and teams", then "Add people".
